# SBA-307-HTML-and_CSS
Hello! This is my SBA. This SBA is a mock website using only HTML and CSS. This is supposed to be a kind of parody or mock website for a game called "X-men: Children of The Atom" made by Marvel and Capcom. A kind of "What if" website if they had the chance to make one back in 1994. It took an unintended kind of retro vibe that I initally didn't intend for but may give it abit charm depending on how you look at it. Personally, I wish I could have done way more and planned to do abunch of stuff that was unfortunetly outside my scope and time, but I won't kick myself too much as this is my first website. Hope you enjoy. Play COTA. THANK YOU!
