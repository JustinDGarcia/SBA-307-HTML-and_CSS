    Sadly, due to the fact that marvel/disney and capcom refuse to interact with each other (You should most likely be blaming disney for that) and this game being 1000000 years old with no modern port, you cannot even legally buy this game. If you really wanna play it, download FightCade2 and download a totally legally obtained rom of the game. There are like a billion tutorials on youtube on how to do that. For now, have this gif of Wolverine being thrown through the air.
